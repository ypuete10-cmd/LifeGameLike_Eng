The following is a reorganized and expanded version of a simple idea memo I had been working on.

This game fuses two existing concepts. One is the Game of Life, also known as cellular automata. This was created more for artificial life research than for play.

The other is the roguelike, a game genre. Notable examples include Slayers Spire and Balatoro.
What made this game groundbreaking was adding yet another layer of randomness. Slot machine symbols become cards. Spinning the slots randomly determines the board layout, triggering each symbol's abilities accordingly. Each spin presents new symbol options.
The game's core idea is to fuse these two concepts. The genes of the Life Game cells are presented as cards, and the traits of newly born cells are obtained as the result of a random draw from the gene pool. In the current system, each time a new cell is born, the score increases by 1 and coins increase by 1. If the score cannot be increased to the target value within a set number of steps, it's game over. I also plan to change this part of the design.
